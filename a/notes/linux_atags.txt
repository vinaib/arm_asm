Bootloader performs below tasks:
1. Setup and initialise the RAM.
The boot loader is expected to find and initialise all RAM that the
kernel will use for volatile data storage in the system.  It performs
this in a machine dependent manner.

2. Initialise one serial port.
3. Detect the machine type.
4. Setup the kernel tagged list.
5. Load initramfs.
6. Call the kernel image.
